# NBA Rookie Data Analysis / Classification

This project is for me to practice with some data analysis techniques in Python.
Whilst the dataset is relatively simple, it is still interesting to find some of the patterns within the data.

## Classification

I am also testing out different classification models in Python in order to predict if the Rookie will stay in the league for 5+ years
